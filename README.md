# 🌐 Wireshark Scan Library — DFIR Packet Analysis Reports

> “Not every weapon is heavy. Some just cut fast.”

This repository is a **dedicated archive of Wireshark packet analysis reports** produced under my #700DaysOfSkill journey — each scan sharpened with tactical intent.

These are not generic tutorials.  
These are forensic dissections — focused, documented, and shared for public intel.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

This repo contains:

-  **Real PCAP analysis cases**
-  **Markdown & PDF reports**
-  **Credential exposures, malware behaviors, DNS leaks**
-  **Protocol filter usage**
-  **Threat reasoning behind every scan**

All captured, analyzed, and documented using **Wireshark GUI**, `tcp.stream` filters, and forensic operator logic.

> New PCAPs, Scans and Reports will be added in future — growing in complexity (C2 beacons, tunneling, malware traffic, credential theft)

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Each scan trains:

- Focused packet triage
- Credential extraction logic
- Protocol awareness (FTP, HTTP, DNS, ICMP, SSL)
- Documentation discipline (stream → finding → risk)
- Operational filter fluency in Wireshark

---

## 🧱 Why This Repo Exists

This is a long-term memory weapon.

I’m building a personal **arsenal of protocol understanding** — not surface knowledge, but operational clarity.

Each `.pcap` and report represents:

- 1 scan
- 1 threat vector internalized
- 1 weakness exposed

No fluff. Just forensic skill compounding over time.

## 🔄 What’s Coming Next

Future Wireshark scans will cover:

- Malware over HTTP/HTTPS
- Covert DNS tunneling
- Beaconing over ICMP
- Credential reuse in plaintext
- PCAP-carved file extraction
- TLS fingerprinting / JA3
- Suspicious user-agent patterns

Each scan will go deeper into **forensic protocol behavior**, mapped to **real-world attacker TTPs**.
