# 🔍 DFIR Ops & Wireshark Scans — CTF-Driven Forensics

Welcome to my growing repository of hands-on forensic analysis reports, Wireshark packet dissections, CTF-style case investigations, and operational recon exercises — all published under the **#700DaysOfSkill** initiative.

> This is not just a collection of solved challenges — this is a living arsenal of DFIR weapons, sharpened daily.

## 📦 Overview

This collection captures practical work in:

- 🔬 **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**
- 🧪 **Memory and Disk Forensics**
- 🌐 **Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)**
- 🧱 **Linux Permissions & Threat Hunting**
- 🎯 **Adversary Simulation & CTF Triages**
- 🧰 **Security Auditing, Detection & Investigation**

Whether you're a student, blue teamer, or self-paced analyst — this repo offers raw, real-world DFIR breakdowns grounded in actual forensic logic.

2. Read the `README.md` or open the `.pdf`
3. Run the Challenge File for yourself
4. Compare with my walkthroughs
5. Extend, publish, improve
